üìÅ Repository Structure

Marshall10232002.github.io/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main single-page site
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css           # Styles for layout, nav, cards, buttons
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # Tab navigation, URL hash, history behavior
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/             # All images used by cards & profile
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/           # Per‚Äëproject detail pages (e.g., Rocket.html)


‚∏ª

üîé How it Works
	‚Ä¢	Navigation:
	‚Ä¢	script.js registers click handlers for #projects, #about, #contact.
	‚Ä¢	It toggles the .active class on the matching .page-section.
	‚Ä¢	It updates the URL hash without scrolling, keeps history entries tidy, and disables the browser‚Äôs default anchor auto-scroll.
	‚Ä¢	Projects grid:
	‚Ä¢	Uses CSS Grid (.projects-grid) with 1 column on small screens and 3 on desktop.
	‚Ä¢	Cards are links (.card-link > .project-card) so the whole card is clickable.
	‚Ä¢	Card layout:
	‚Ä¢	Image has fixed aspect ratio + crop (aspect-ratio: 16/9; object-fit: cover;).
	‚Ä¢	.card-body is a flex column; the View Details button uses margin-top: auto so it sticks to the bottom regardless of text length.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Locally

You can open index.html directly in a browser, or serve it with a simple HTTP server for cleaner testing:

# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000

‚ûï Add a New Project Card
	1.	Add assets to images/ (thumbnail, etc.).
	2.	Create a detail page in projects/ (copy an existing file like Rocket.html).
	3.	Add a card inside the #projects .projects-grid in index.html:

<a href="projects/your-project.html" class="card-link">
  <article class="project-card">
    <img src="images/your_image.jpg" alt="Your Project" />
    <div class="card-body">
      <h3>Your Project Title</h3>
      <p class="type">Category or Role</p>
      <p class="excerpt">One-sentence summary of what you built.</p>
      <div class="tag-row">
        <span class="tag">Tech 1</span><span class="tag">Tech 2</span>
      </div>
      <span class="btn">View Details</span>
    </div>
  </article>
</a>

Notes
	‚Ä¢	Keep titles concise.
	‚Ä¢	Use descriptive alt text on images for accessibility.
	‚Ä¢	If an image is missing, the card still reserves height so the grid stays aligned.

‚∏ª

üé® Customize
	‚Ä¢	Theme width: Controlled by the body { max-width: 1000px; } rule.
	‚Ä¢	Card image height: Controlled by .project-card img { height: 200px; }.
	‚Ä¢	Primary button style: .btn and .btn-outline in style.css.
	‚Ä¢	Nav active state: nav a:not(.brand).active.

‚∏ª

‚ôø Accessibility & UX
	‚Ä¢	Clear focus states (inherits browser defaults) and large touch targets.
	‚Ä¢	Semantic HTML (<main>, <section>), descriptive alt attributes.
	‚Ä¢	Avoid empty links; the whole card uses a single <a> for clarity.
